# Analyzing-police-activity:
It is a data set of traffic stop by police officers. Data set was taken from Stanford open policing
project https://openpolicing.stanford.edu. Finding are as below:



About two-thirds of female traffic stops are for speeding, whereas stops of
males are more balanced among the six categories of violation. About 95 % of
stops for speeding result in a ticket and the numbers are similar for males and
females.
For all types of violations, the search rate is higher for males than for females.

The frisk rate is higher for males than for females and the rate of drug-related
stops nearly doubled over the course of 10 years

The arrest rate increases as the weather gets worse, and that trend persists
across many of the violation types.
